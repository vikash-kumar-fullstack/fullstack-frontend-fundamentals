## What is a Programming Language?

A programming language:

- Performs logic
- Uses conditions
- Uses loops
- Stores values
- Executes calculations

Example:

```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 10;
console.log(a + b);
```

## Why JavaScript is Important?

HTML → Structure
CSS → Design
JavaScript → Brain / Logic

## History /Birth of JS

In 1995, Brendan Eich created JavaScript in just 10 days while working at Netscape.

Initially, it was named:
    Mocha
    Then renamed to LiveScript
    Finally renamed to JavaScript (for marketing reasons)

The name JavaScript was chosen to associate it with Java, which was popular at the time.

Despite the name, Java and JavaScript are completely different languages.
In the late 1990s, major browsers competed aggressively:
    Netscape Navigator
    Internet Explorer

Each browser implemented JavaScript differently, causing compatibility issues.

To standardize the language, ECMAScript was introduced as the official specification.

## Google Chrome and the V8 Engine

In 2008, Google released the Chrome browser.

Chrome introduced a powerful JavaScript engine called V8.

## What is V8?

V8 is a JavaScript engine written in C++.

It compiles JavaScript directly into machine code instead of interpreting it line by line.

This made JavaScript significantly faster.

## Impact of Chrome

Chrome's performance improvements revolutionized web applications:
    Faster execution
    Better memory management
    Improved stability

JavaScript was no longer limited to small webpage interactions.

## Birth of Node.js

In 2009, Ryan Dahl extracted the V8 engine from Chrome.

He embedded V8 into a standalone runtime environment.

This environment allowed JavaScript to run outside the browser.

This project became Node.js.

## Why Was This Revolutionary?

Before Node.js:
    JavaScript only ran inside browsers.

After Node.js:
    JavaScript could run on servers.
    Developers could build backend applications using JavaScript.
    Full Stack JavaScript became possible.

Ryan Dahl did not create a new language.
He created an environment powered by V8.
