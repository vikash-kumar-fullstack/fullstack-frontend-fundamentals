## Web Browsers

A web browser is a client-side software application that enables users to access and render web content.
## Core Responsibilities
    Send HTTP requests to servers.
    Receive HTTP responses.
    Parse HTML and CSS.
    Execute JavaScript.
    Render the final visual output.


## Rendering Engine

Inside every browser exists a rendering engine responsible for transforming raw code into a visual webpage.

The rendering process follows these steps:
    Parse HTML => Construct DOM Tree
    Parse CSS => Construct CSSOM
    Combine DOM and CSSOM => Create Render Tree
    Layout calculation
    Paint pixels on screen

## Practical Example

When you open an e-commerce website:
    The browser downloads HTML.
    CSS determines styling.
    JavaScript dynamically loads products.
    The rendering engine paints the interface.
