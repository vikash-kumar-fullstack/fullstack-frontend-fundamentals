## Git
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during development.

It allows multiple developers to collaborate without overwriting each other's work.

## Why Git is Important
    Tracks project history
    Enables branching
    Supports collaboration
    Allows rollback to previous versions

## real example

Consider writing a research paper.

Without version control:
    You might overwrite important changes.
    You cannot revert to older drafts easily.


Git maintains a complete timeline of changes.

## GitHub
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and enables collaborative software development.

It is not a version control system itself; it is built on top of Git.

#Key Features
    Remote repository hosting
    Pull requests
    Issue tracking
    Collaboration tools
    CI/CD integration

## Git vs GitHub

Git is a version control system whereas GitHub is a hosting platform for Git repositories.
