# 🌐 How The Web Works

## 1️⃣ What is Internet?

The Internet is a global network of computers connected together.

It allows devices to communicate using standard rules called protocols.

Example:
Your Laptop → WiFi → ISP → Server → Response back to you

---

## 2️⃣ What is a Website?

A website is a collection of web pages stored on a server.

Example:
When you open google.com, your browser requests files (HTML, CSS, JS) from Google's server.

---

## 3️⃣ What is Client and Server?

Client → Device requesting data (Browser)

Server → Device responding with data

Flow:
Client sends Request → Server sends Response

---

## 4️⃣ What is HTTP?

HTTP = HyperText Transfer Protocol

It is a communication rule between browser and server.

Example:
You type:
https://google.com

Browser sends HTTP request → Server sends HTML response.

---

## 5️⃣ What is DNS?

DNS = Domain Name System

It converts domain name into IP address.

Example:
google.com → 142.250.183.14

Without DNS, we would need to remember numbers.
