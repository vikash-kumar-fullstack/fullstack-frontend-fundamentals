## What is a Markup Language?

A markup language:

- Uses tags
- Defines structure
- Does NOT perform logic
- Does NOT execute calculations

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>

=>This tells browser:
Display "Hello" as heading.

## Why HTML is Important?
HTML = Skeleton of website
Without structure, nothing can be styled or scripted.
