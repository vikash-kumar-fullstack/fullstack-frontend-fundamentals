    1️⃣ What are HTML Entities?

HTML entities are special codes used to display reserved characters
that normally have special meaning in HTML.

Example:
The symbol "<" is used to start a tag.
So if we write <p>, browser thinks it's a tag.

To display "<" as text, we use an HTML entity.

---

2️⃣ Why Do We Need HTML Entities?

Because some characters are RESERVED in HTML:

<  → used for tags
>  → used for tags
&  → used for entities
"  → used in attributes
'  → used in attributes

If we want to show them as normal text,
we must use HTML entities.

<h1>HTML Entities Example</h1>

<!-- Less than symbol -->
<p>To display &lt; we use &amp;lt;</p>

<!-- Greater than symbol -->
<p>To display &gt; we use &amp;gt;</p>

<!-- Ampersand symbol -->
<p>To display &amp; we use &amp;amp;</p>

<!-- Double quotation mark -->
<p>To display &quot; we use &amp;quot;</p>

<!-- Single quotation mark -->
<p>To display &apos; we use &amp;apos;</p>

<!-- Example showing HTML code as text -->
<p>Example of showing a tag as text:</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<!-- 
3️⃣ Some Common HTML Entities

&lt;  → <
&gt;  → >
&amp; → &
&quot; → "
&apos; → '
&nbsp; → Non-breaking space

---

4️⃣ What is &nbsp; ?

&nbsp; means "non-breaking space"

It adds extra space between words.
-->

<p>This&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sentence&nbsp;has&nbsp;extra&nbsp;space.</p>

<!-- 
Summary:

HTML entities are used to display reserved characters.

Without entities:
Browser will think it is HTML code.

With entities:
Browser shows them as normal text.
