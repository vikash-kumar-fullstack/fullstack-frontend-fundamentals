    BLOCK vs INLINE ELEMENTS
1️⃣ What is a Block Element?

A block element:

- Takes full width of the page
- Starts on a new line
- Can contain other block and inline elements

Examples:
div, p, h1-h6, ul, li, section

2️⃣ What is an Inline Element?

An inline element:

- Takes only required width
- Does NOT start on a new line
- Cannot contain block elements

Examples:
span, a, b, i, strong, em
